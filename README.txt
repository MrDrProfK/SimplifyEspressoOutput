How to use "Simplify Espresso Output" to make your life easier:

Step #1: Compile source code.

Step #2: Use Espresso Logic Minimizer (found elsewhere) to generate an output text file.

      For example...
      directoryContainingEspresso$ ./espresso pathToInputFile.txt > pathToOutputFile.txt

      *Please note how the output redirect character ">" is used to send what would 
      normally appear as standard output in a terminal window to a file of your choosing

Step #3: Run compiled source code.

      For example...
      directoryContainingCompiledSource$ ./compiledsource pathToOutputFile.txt

Step #4: Choose run mode to produced simplified Espresso output, simulate combinational logic, or both!

Step #5: Open "pathToOutputFile_simplified.txt" (if "Simplify Espresso output" feature is enabled)

      *Please note that the numbered equations represent products of terms, 
      while the numbers next to the output labels at the top represent the particular 
      equations needed for the sums of products.

Step #6: Thank me later:)
